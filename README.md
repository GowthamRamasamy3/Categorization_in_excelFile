# Categorization_in_excelFile
This project categorizes financial transactions from an Excel file into "Self," "UPI," "IMPS," and "Loan" categories based on transaction descriptions. It uses Python and pandas for data processing, and Matplotlib for visualization. The categorized data is saved to a new Excel file, and the distribution of categories is displayed as a bar chart.
